        * VERSION: podlators 0.04 released.

        * Makefile.PL: Use File::Spec to build file paths for portability,
        removed the dist setting since current Perls get this right, and
        added the magic to cope with pod2txt as a .PL file.

        * scripts/pod2txt.PL: Added the .PL magic to fix the shebang line
        that will be necessary when this script is part of Perl core.

        --loose.

        * VERSION: podlators 0.02 released.

        * lib/Pod/PlainText.pm: Added a pod2text() function for backwards
        compatibility.

        * Makefile.PL: Changed the name of the package to podlators.

        * lib/Pod/PlainText.pm: Fixed a spurious space with =for text
        commands, check the content of sequences against '' specifically
        rather than testing truth so that it does the right thing with 0,
        process sequences for =head headings, and changed the name from
        SimpleText to PlainText.  Also speeded up some sequences slightly.
