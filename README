BLURB

  podlators contains Pod::Man and Pod::Text modules which convert POD
  input to *roff source output, suitable for man pages, or plain text.  It
  also includes several subclasses of Pod::Text for formatted output to
  terminals with various capabilities.  It is the source package for the
  Pod::Man and Pod::Text modules included with Perl.

DESCRIPTION

  This package contains the replacement for pod2text and Pod::Text in
  versions of Perl 5.005 and earlier.  It also contains Pod::Man and
  pod2man, the replacement for pod2man found in Perl distributions prior
  to 5.6.0.  The modules contained in it use Pod::Simple rather than doing
  the POD parsing themselves, and are designed to be object-oriented and
  to subclass.  As an example, three useful subclasses of Pod::Text are
  also included: Pod::Text::Color, which uses ANSI color escape sequences
  to highlight text, Pod::Text::Termcap, which determines the correct
  control sequences to embolden and underline text from terminal termcap
  information, and Pod::Text::Overstrike, which uses the backspacing
  method of underlining and bold also used by the output of nroff.

  Both Pod::Text and Pod::Man provide a variety of options for fine-tuning
  their output.  Pod::Man also tries to massage input text where
  appropriate to produce better output when run through nroff or troff,
  such as distinguishing between different types of hyphens and using
  slightly smaller case for acronyms.

  A general parser utility module for L<> formatting code parsing is also
  included, Pod::ParseLink.  This implements only the simple parse
  described in perlpodspec.  It is no longer used by the modules here
  (Pod::Simple has a separate implementation of the same concept), but is
  included in case others find it useful.

REQUIREMENTS

  Perl 5.6.0 or later and Module::Build are required to build this module.
  Both Pod::Man and Pod::Text are built on Pod::Simple, which handles the
  basic POD parsing and character set conversion.  Pod::Simple 3.06 or
  later is required (and Pod::Simple 3.07 is recommended).  It is
  available from CPAN and part of Perl core as of 5.10.0.  Encode is also
  required (included in Perl core since 5.8.0).

  To run the test suite, Test::More is required.  It is available from
  CPAN and part of Perl core as of 5.6.2.

  To enable tests that don't detect functionality problems but are used to
  sanity-check the release, set the environment variable RELEASE_TESTING
  to a true value.  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local
  environment or that produce a lot of false positives without uncovering
  many problems, set the environment variable AUTHOR_TESTING to a true
  value.  For these tests, the additional Perl modules:

      Test::MinimumVersion
      Test::Pod
      Test::Spelling
      Test::Strict
      Test::Synopsis

  and their dependencies as well as a spell-checking program (several are
  supported by Test::Spelling) are required.  These modules are all
  available from CPAN.

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

  Installation of this package will shadow the Pod::Man, Pod::Text, and
  subclasses that come with Perl.  The ones from Perl will not be
  overwritten, but the ones installed by this package will generally take
  precendent.  This may result in different behavior than using the
  versions in Perl.  It will probably also shadow the perlpodstyle man
  page.

  Normally, the pod2man and pod2text scripts installed by this package
  will go into a directory like /usr/local/bin.  Be sure that this
  directory is earlier in your PATH than the directory containing the
  modules installed by Perl itself (often /usr/bin).  Otherwise, you will
  call the new modules with the old driver scripts, which may cause
  various problems.

  Follow the standard installation procedure for Perl modules using
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker, which is to type the following commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  You'll probably need to do the last step as root.  This will also
  install driver scripts named pod2text and pod2man and the perlpodstyle
  man page.

SUPPORT

  The podlators web page at:

      http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/podlators/

  will always have the current version of this package, the current
  documentation, and pointers to any additional resources.

  For bug tracking, this package uses the CPAN bug tracker at:

      https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=podlators

  I welcome bug reports and patches for this package at rra@cpan.org
  or via the CPAN bug tracker.  However, please be aware that I tend to be
  extremely busy and work projects often take priority.  I'll save your
  mail and get to it as soon as I can, but it may take me a couple of
  months.

SOURCE REPOSITORY

  podlators is maintained using Git.  You can access the current source
  by cloning the repository at:

      git://git.eyrie.org/perl/podlators.git

  or view the repository on the web at:

      http://git.eyrie.org/?p=perl/podlators.git

  You can also use GitHub via:

      http://github.com/rra/podlators

  The eyrie.org repository is the canonical one, maintained by the author,
  but using GitHub is probably more convenient for most purposes.  Pull
  requests are gratefully reviewed and normally accepted.  It's probably
  better to use the CPAN bug tracker than GitHub issues, though, to keep
  all Perl module issues in the same place.
